# Technology Roadmap

Planned incremental additions:
- Redis (idempotency, locks, caching)
- PostgreSQL (authoritative job storage)
- Kafka (event-driven processing)
- KEDA (autoscaling by queue lag)
- Prometheus + Grafana
- Loki for centralized logs
- k6 for load testing
- Security hardening and policy enforcement (later)

All additions are introduced only when they add architectural value.
