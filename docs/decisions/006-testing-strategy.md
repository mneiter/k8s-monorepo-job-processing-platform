# Testing Strategy

Testing is layered and incremental.

## Layers
- Unit tests
- Contract tests (Proto-based)
- Integration tests (docker compose)
- End-to-end tests (minimal)
- Load testing with k6 (later stage)

## Quality Gates
- Test execution from the start
- Code coverage checks enabled early
